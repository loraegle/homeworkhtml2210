<p class="p1">
    Jugendhaus Park In is a youth centre where I did my European Voluntary Service (currently called European Solidarity Corps Volunteering activity, <a href="https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en" target="blank">click here for more information</a>) from October 2018 till September 2019. 
The youth centre is located in in Austrian Alps, in a small town Hall in Tirol. Park In is the meeting point for young people of all ages from Hall and the surrounding area, it offers a wide range of leisure and cultural activities, as well as social help.

        <h3>My EVS year in Park In</h3>
<p>
During my EVS year in Park In the core activities were working about 30 hours per week in the youth centre, learning German language, participating in self-development and reflection meetings together with other volunteers in the region of Tirol and whole Austria, travelling inside Austria and within its neighbouring countries.
My duties in the youth centre were:
<ol>
    <li>interacting and communicating with youngsters;</li>
    <li>cooking meals for school lunch break;</li>
    <li>working at so called Park In bar - preparing snacks and drinks; handing out games; ensuring the music; </li>
    <li>organizing events and workshops;</li>
    <li>keeping the youth centre clean and in order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the previously mentioned activities I also took the chance to participate in other projects offered by coordinating organization in Tirol and European Solidarity Corps itself. Together with another volunteer from France I developed an exhibition about the volunteers in Tirol and their opinions about Europe before European Parliament elections in 2019. <a href="#exhibition">See the photo below!</a>  
I also participated in European Solidarity Corps experience story contest and got into TOP10 in Europe, you can read my story <a href="https://europa.eu/youth/node/67930_en?fbclid=IwAR0Wd_bXuE6NkH7FXGU1ei4aO1moqpvJ6DVoBDM6rcPN-Vw14rwnH9Jc1qQ" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Benefits and challenges</h3>
    <p> The EVS year in Park In is one of the greatest things that I have experienced! I volunteered in an amazing workplace, met so many wonderful people and created unforgettable memories. 
        The best things from my EVS experience are:
        <ul>
            <li>significant self-development;</li>
            <li>new practical and personal skills;</li>
            <li>meeting various people from all around the world;</li>
            <li>travelling and exploring many new places;</li>
            <li>overcoming some of my weaknesses and fears.</li>
        </ul>
<p> Despite all the great memories about my experience in Park In, I had to overcome several challenges during the year, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>living in German environment with limited knowledge of German language;</li>
    <li>emotional challenges when meeting youngsters from disadvantaged background;</li>
    <li>homesickness and differences in culture and mentality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, I would like to encourage every young person to challenge himself or herself and join European Solidarity Corps! It will for sure be a life-changing experience and probably one of the best things in your life!
I am thankful to Park In for being an amazing EVS host organization and making my experience so valuable!</p>
